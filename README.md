# Paint in Java

## About
This program is Paint, as in all Windows PC's, but in Java using JFrame and Canvas!

## How to
Select among many different colors (included color wheel provided by Java, if you are not satisfied with the default colors provided), shapes, and sizes to paint on this wonderful canvas.

Comes on a yellow canvas with red gradation figure, resembling my very own design, which was selected to mark work and operations during military service. Have fun decorating the rest!
